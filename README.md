# Dbmover\Procedures
DbMover plugin to (re)create procedures

## Installation
```sh
$ composer require dbmover/procedures
```

## Usage
See `dbmover/core` for general usage instructions.

## Notes
Since procedure syntax is _very_ vendor-dependant, vendors will likely supply
their own plugin for this.

## Contributing
See `dbmover/core`.
